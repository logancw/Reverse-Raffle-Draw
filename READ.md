## Assignment  Goal: This lab was designed for you to show more of what you know about Arrays and ArrayList class.

## Project Description:
A reverse raffle is a raffle draw where the name drawn from a hat they DOES NOT win. The last name drawn is the actual winner.

Create a reverse raffle draw using an array or ArrayList with the following requirements:

At least 10 names start in the "hat"
There is an output explaining the game before it starts
There is an output listing the names that have been removed each pick
There is an output listing the winner when there is only one name left.
You may want to use a delay as well to help create space between picks. I have never reviewed how to do that in an assignment but the way I put a delay into my loops is by using  Thread.sleep(100);
 
## Comment Requirements:

- Program name: (The name you gave the program)

- Student name: (Your name)
